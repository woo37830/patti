<br class="">
I am trying to be able to receive an email to my mailnugger email account and pass the email content to a php script.&nbsp; The script can run on AWS or on my own Mac OS X server.&nbsp; There I need to be able to look up the sender and recipient emails in a data table I keep and append a note containing the email to the senders CRM account via an API.&nbsp; This provides a trace of the emails the sender received and replied to from their contracts by using a bcc when they respond to the email.&nbsp; The bcc would contain the mailnuggets email account.<br class="">
<br class="">
Is there a way I can forward received emails to a remote server that has a php web page?<br class="">
<br class="">
I don’t have access to cPanel which I’ve seen a lot of references to that do this?&nbsp; <br class="">
