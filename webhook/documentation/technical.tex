\noindent The technical description of a database and web application
for tracking and managing EngagemoreCRM customers and their payments.
The Thrivecart application is used to allow customers to sign up for various
subscription options.  Their signups result in a webhook notification being sent to
the thrivecart.php webhook.  This processes their action and creates or modifies
the customers EngagemoreCRM account.  The software codes for the modules making up the webhook are porvided in the Appendices\footnote{\url{https://texblog.org/2008/04/02/include-source-code-in-latex-with-listings/}}

\section{Introduction}
\noindent Customers who desire to utilize the {\bf EngagemoreCRM}\footnote{\url{https://secure.engagemorecrm.com/Login.aspx}} services, are directed from a webpage
where the description of the EngagemoreCRM site is found along with a comparison of various offerings
to a {\bf Thrivecart}\footnote{\url{https://thrivecart.com/signin/}} site where they enter their subscription information including their {\it email} and their credit card information, which Thrivecart manages.
Upon completion of their signup, a webhook notication is sent to the webhook {\bf thrivecart.php} on
a server used by EngagemoreCRM.  That webhook, updates the customer information stored in a mysql
database called {\bf user\_db/users}, which keeps the customers {\it email} and after adding the user to EngagemoreCRM,
their {\it engagemoreId} and the status, either {\it active} or {\it in-active}.  A web-app is available to examine the users database table, and also
the logs database table. The logs database table {\bf user\_db/logs} contains the logs of each transaction received
from Thrivecart.


\section{Approach}
\noindent In order to process thrivecart events that are related to EngagemoreCRM users, we must connect
the {\it email} which is sent by Thrivecart when a user is added to the EngagemoreCRM  id that
occurs when a new user is created within EngagemoreCRM.  This allows us to manage future Thrivecart
notifications about cancellation of their subscription and possible upgrades in their subscription, as well as use various API's and Zapier\footnote{\url{https://platform.zapier.com/quickstart/introduction}} notificatons to add contacts to a users account.

\newpage
\section{Database Tables}
\noindent There are two database tables, users, and logs that are used by the webhook.  Their structures are:
\smallskip

\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Name&Type&Null&Default&Extra\\ \hline
id&int(11)&No&None&Auto Increment\\
added&datetime&No&None&\\
email&varchar(128)&No&None&\\
engagemoreid&varchar(64)&No&None&\\
orderid&int(11)&No&None&\\
invoiceid&int(11)&No&None&\\
status&varchar(256)&No&None&\\
product&varchar(255)&No&None&\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:users}users table.}
\end{table}

\newpage
\noindent and:
\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Name&Type&Null&Default&Extra\\ \hline
id&int(11)&No&None&AutoIncrement\\
received&datetime&No&None&\\
email&varchar(128)&No&None&\\
request\_json&varchar(16000)&No&None&\\
status&varchar(128)&No&None&\\
commit\_hash&varchar(64)&Yes&NULL&None\\
branch&varchar(64)&Yes&NULL&None\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:logs}logs table.}
\end{table}

\section{Flow Chart}
\noindent The following chart shows the events and the actions that happen is response to them.

\section{config.ini.php}
\noindent The config.ini.php page provides the externalized constants so that if the server address changes, it can be changed in one place.  Passwords are maintained here also, and thus this file is {\bf NOT} checked into the github\footnote{https://github.com} repository but are passed in by copying from the Trello\footnote{http://thrivecart.com} site where they are specified.

%\lstset{language=PHP,caption=config.ini.php,label=code:config}
\lstinputlisting{../config.ini.php}

\section{mysql\_common.php}
\noindent The file, mysql.comon.php, contains common mysql functions that all of the other files often share.  Such things as connect, logging to the logs database(see Table \ref{tab:logs}) getStatus, etc. are here.

%\lstset{language=PHP,caption=mysql\_common.php,label=code:common}
\lstinputlisting{../mysql_common.php}

\section{thrivecart\_api.php}
\noindent This page contains the logic to communicate the data received from the Thrivecart notification system to the EngagemoreCRM system.  The data and the specific EngagemoreCRM function will cause such actions as adding a user, changing their status from active to inactive, and changing the group in EngagemoreCRM to which they belong.

\lstinputlisting{../thrivecart_api.php}

\section{thrivecart.php}
\noindent This is the php page that is added to the Thrivecart site to receive the notifications when actions are taken in Thrivecart such as someone signing up, cancelling, etc.  It contains a switch statement that uses the event provided by Thrivecart to select the proper EngagemoreCRM API to perform the desired EngagemoreCRM action.  All notifications result in a logging event, and if the event is one supported by the webhook, then the proper API is invoked and the results are logged.  If a user is added, modified, or cancelled, the status is added or modified in the users(see Table \ref{tab:users}) data table.

\lstinputlisting{../thrivecart.php}

\section{utilities.php}
\noindent A set of functions used in tests and in the main thrivecart.php application.

\lstinputlisting{../utilities.php}

\section{add\_account.php}
\noindent The file, add\_account.php, handles the addition of the user who has just signed up through Thrivecart to the EngagemoreCRM system.  Depending upon which product they selected, the proper EngagemoreCRM group is selected and the data is added to the users table and marked as 'active'.

\lstinputlisting{../add_account.php}

\section{change\_account\_status.php}
\noindent Depending upon certain activities, the account status might be changed rom 'active' to 'inactive'.  This file provides the update function for that and communicates to EngagemoreCRM by either suspending or activating an account.

\lstinputlisting{../change_account_status.php}

\section{post\_api\_url.php}
\noindent This file was provided as a model by EngagemoreCRM to add users, change their status, etc. by the arguments provided.

\lstinputlisting{../post_api_url.php}

\section{upgrade\_account.php}
\noindent If the user decides to change their subscription, they can upgrade or downgrade their experiences in EngagemoreCRM.  This file handles those changes.

\lstinputlisting{../upgrade_account.php}

\section{git-info.php}
\noindent This file is provided to show, in certain cases the revision, branch, and database that is being used for particular transactions.  

\lstinputlisting{../git-info.php}
